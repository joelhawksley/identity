SoloFolio is a portfolio website platform for visual artists.

SoloFolio started out as a WordPress theme I built in high school to publish my photography portfolio. In college, a few friends asked to use it for their sites, so I turned it into a <abbr title="Software-as-a-Service">SaaS</abbr> platform.

I've since rewritten it in Ruby on Rails, using it as a test bed for new technologies I want to learn, such as React.
