In the summer of 2020, my wife, dog and I had moved into the home we hoped to raise a family in. Like many of us in the industry, I lived a comfortable life. A life of privilege. We had little to worry about.

That all changed about a year and half later, at the very end of 2021.

While we were out of Colorado on a road trip for the holidays, I got a text message from a friend in town about a fire evacuation.

We got the evacuation order a little bit before 3pm.

Soon after, falling ash triggered our front door security camera, triggering motion alerts every minute. I had to turn them off. I was regretting having backup power for my modem.

Over the course of an afternoon, the news got increasingly dire. Homes were burning in our town, but we didn't know if ours survived.

It wasn't until the following morning that I checked twitter and saw a drone video of our neighborhood.

Over a hundred homes in our neighborhood burned to the ground, including ours.

For the first time, I saw the world through the eyes of trauma, panic, overwhelm. Our lives were turned upside down.

One memory that sticks out to me is realizing two weeks later that I hadn't walked Captain since the first. I literally hadn't even thought to do something that I used to do three or four times a day before.

I noticed other things too. It was harder for me to focus. I got angry easily. I remember struggling to use my password manager on my phone.

What I soon learned was that emotional trauma can cause brain damage. In my case, both temporarily and permanently.

Here is how this experience has changed my perspective on my work.
