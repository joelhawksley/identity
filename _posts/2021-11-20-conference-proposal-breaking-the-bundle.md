## Abstract

## Details

## Pitch

I am a staff engineer at GitHub, leading GitHub's work on addressing our significant frontend technical debt.

I am the creator and lead maintainer of ViewComponent, GitHub's framework for building reusable, testable & encapsulated view components in Rails. The ViewComponent framework has received significant attention in the Rails community, and is foundational to several up and coming Rails ecosystem libraries including StimulusReflex.

I'm also the author of the support for 3rd-party component frameworks introduced in Rails 6.1, along with other view-related improvements such as template annotations and the `class_names` helper. In addition, I maintain the Primer ViewComponents library, an open-source Ruby gem of ViewComponents for the Primer Design System.

This talk builds on previous RailsConf talks: In 2019 I shared a prototype for view components in Rails, in 2020 I gave a technical deep-dive into how a lack of encapsulation affects Rails views and in 2021 I shared what we learned scaling up to hundreds of ViewComponents. Through sharing concrete examples from the GitHub codebase, I'll help attendees understand how their applications might benefit from using ViewComponents.

I've already given the talk to our local Ruby group and internally at GitHub, and it's been well-received.
