title: 7 Habits of a Thriving Staff Engineer
---

_A transcript of my 2026 talk, as presented at Boulder Ruby._

Intro
  A little over a year ago, Jesse from Stripe gave a talk here about what it means to be a senior engineer. At the time, I took a mental note about doing a similar talk for the staff level.

  This past year, I took paternity leave to bond with our second child. In my time away from work, I spoke at Rocky Mountain Ruby. It was great to see many of you there! At the speaker dinner the night before the conference, I was chatting with Becki about our jobs as staff engineers and we quickly realized how different they were!

  Many of my conversations with fellow staff engineers both at GitHub and elsewhere take this turn. Even with a shared language of Will Larson's staff engineer archetypes, it can be disconcerting to try to relate to others in the role, let alone learn what it takes to thrive in it.

  I've been a staff engineer for four years now. I am regularly asked: What is your job? How do I get promoted to staff? Do I want to be a staff engineer? Today I'm going to attempt to answer those questions, based on my experience and conversations I've had with other staff engineers inside and outside GitHub. My selfish goal is that you'll poke tons of holes in everything I have to say so that you can help me improve my practice!

  Of course, what I'm sharing here is just my opinion and not that of GitHub's or any of my previous employers.
How I got here
  I started my software career at MojoTech (a software consultancy) first as a level-one apprentice. From there, I promoted to "developer", no prefix. Another year later, I was promoted to "lead developer," which was more or less Senior. There were no levels beyond that.
  At my next job, a startup, I was hired at and remained at Senior.
  A year later, I left for another startup. My title was also Senior. Six months later, I was promoted to Lead Engineer. There were maybe two dozen engineers and as a Lead, I reported to the VP of engineering. I had one engineer who reported to me.
  6 months after that, I joined GitHub as a no-prefix "engineer", ostensibly going down two levels, but for decent pay increase. GitHub had a few hundred (maybe ~300) engineers at the time. We had a total of eight engineering levels: Intern, 1/2/3, Senior, Staff, Principal, and Distinguished. Our system remains more or less the same today with ~1,000 engineers.

Table of contents
  I'll start by trying to define the role with examples from my experience, then share a collection of habits I believe are critical to thriving as staff.
Defining the role
  Before I get to far, a quick survey: how many people here would call themselves Junior? Senior? Staff plus?
  What makes a engineer staff? Well, it's not senior. And it's not principal. Perhaps it's best to use the term staff+ to encompass the roles beyond senior. In my experience, the staff level is _beyond_ terminal, in that it's totally OK to never go beyond Senior for your entire career.

  Scope, breadth vs. depth
  Longer time horizon, cross-team
Habits
  Align with archetypes
    Use the archetypes to align with your manager
    I've struggled with this
    Archetype example
      Right Hand
        Manager leave coverage
      Solver
        ViewComponent
      Tech Lead
        A11y
      Architect
        Primer ViewComponents
    Really about making sure you and your manager agree about what your job is. True of all levels.
  Predict the future
    Keep up on trends internally and externally. hacker newsletter, ruby news, a11y news when I was working in a11y
    Opportunity is unevenly distributed across time/teams
  Speak truth to power
    As an IC, I've often had moments where I felt like leadership didn't care enough about what I cared about. Whether it was code quality, tech debt, software craftsmanship.

    Check and balance on product by surfacing and justifying engineering-driven priorities.
    Use of stats
      Example: mining request data
  Disambiguate, then delegate
    Solving ambiguity through research, proofs of concept, reading papers, connecting with industry peers
  Keep a journal
  Build conceptual consensus
    Not consensus. Shared mental models. bruce - what is the problem here? how will we know we've solved it?
  Generate energy
    ViewComponent migration project was a big part of my staff packet
