title: Advice for new developers
---

_A collection of advice for new developers, especially those from a non-traditional background like mine. Based on a talk I regularly give at Flatiron School and notes from a panel of managers hiring new developers at [RubyConf 2021](https://rubyconf.org)._

## Networking

- Act as though you will work with (or report to) everyone you meet. You probably will.

## Resumes

- One page is plenty.
- Use measurements when possible, even if they're course-grained. (_10,000 requests per minute_, _$2 million budget_)

## Phone screens

- Most companies use these to make sure you did what your resume says you did.
- The phone screen is often the same regardless of the level of the position.
- For new developers, they are trying to see if you can do the job at all.
- Enthusiasm goes a long way.
- Demonstrate a desire to learn.
- Fail by not knowing anything about the company you're talking to.
- Fail by talking negatively about previous jobs and colleagues.
- Fail by being a jerk to the people you talk to.

## Interviewing

- Ask them how they make money.
- If you don't understand a question, ask for clarification.
- Describe things you did, not what your team did.
- Talk about times you organized people or projects. It doesn't have to be technical work.
- Talk about how you've handled ambiguity, such as figuring out the needs of a customer.
- The worst thing you can do is answer a question you don't have the answer to.
- State your assumptions.
- Play the meta game. Ask the interviewer what they are looking for. Ask them for the rubric.

## Take-homes

- Don't be too clever. For Rails developers, do it the Rails way.
- Document steps needed to run the code you write.
- If (and when) your take-home is incomplete, explain why.
- Take-homes can have deliberate mistakes, hidden aspects, and things meant to prompt questions from you.
- Your PR description matters as much as your code.

## Culture fit

- Ask them about their last vacation.
- Ask if they have Slack on their phone.
- Ask them what their retention rates are. By gender.
- Send them an email on a Friday night, and hope you don't get a response before Monday.

## Evaluating job opportunities

- Quality of experience is more significant than quantity. I got five years' worth of experience in two years of work as a consultant.
- Options and stock in startups can be worth something but are nearly always worth nothing. They will seldom make up for the decreased salary you'll take in exchange.
- Run, don't walk away from jobs where you'll be the only developer or where the only devs are new to the field as well.
