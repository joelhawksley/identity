title: Born a Crime by Trevor Noah
---

I’ll keep this short, as I don’t want to spoil the book for you.

Noah’s memoir of growing up in newly post-apartheid South Africa opened my eyes to how other nations have struggled with racial segregation. I regret not reading it before traveling to South Africa, as it provides significant context of what life was like during an incredibly contentious time in the country’s history.

Definitely worth a read or listen.
