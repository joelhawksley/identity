## My Unifi Protect bird nest camera setup

### TL;DR

Open up a [Unifi G5 Bullet](https://store.ui.com/us/en/products/uvc-g5-bullet) camera to adjust the manual focus distance for usage in close quarters, such as a bird nest.

### Background

Before our house burned down in the Marshall Fire, we had a few families of House finches that nested in the pine tree outside of my office window. Their comings and goings were a nice form of entertainment while working from home. 

During the process of rebuilding our home, the finches took up residence in our framed-out house in the spring, raising a few clutches. Once the building was closed in, we wondered where they would nest, as our neighborhood lost most of its trees in the fire.

As the finishing touches went on the house, we realized that we were creating the perfect nesting spots in the hollowed-out tops of the craftsman-style pre-fabricated corbels under our roof gables, of which there are about 20 on our home. On most of of them, the top was exposed.

While we didn't want to deter all nesting, we had our builder close off all but the four that sit above windows on the main floor of the house. And sure enough, we were right! The finches took up the new spot with much delight, nesting in two of the four last spring.

Did the prep work in the fall to avoid scaring the birds away
