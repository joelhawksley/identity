_Four-light setup at Frankfort Community High School in West Frankfort, Ill._

Great light is the foundation of great pictures. When I worked as the chief photographer at the Ohio University Athletic Department, I designed and implemented a lighting system at The Convo, a 13,000-seat arena in the heart of Athens, Ohio.

Over the past two months, I have taken what I developed at Ohio and translated it down to a much smaller scale, covering prep basketball games all across Southern Illinois for work. Here's what I've learned.

_My gallery edit from a recent basketball game. Since I used lights, I only needed to crop the images before transmitting._

## Why light sports?

I get a lot of questions about why I light every high school game I shoot.

The first reason is simple: color. Artificial lighting, especially the kind used in high school gyms, has a tendency to shift colors shot-to-shot, requiring correction in post. It is very hard for even the highest-end cameras to compensate for this problem. Since flash tubes output an even and full spectrum of light, the color of every image is perfectly balanced, which is incredibly important with skin tones.

Most importantly, having this balance drastically increases the final print quality. Having clean exposures also helps streamline my coverage workflow.

I shoot a LOT of basketball. Just last week, I shot seven games in four days. I average about twenty captioned images for the photo gallery from each game I shoot, which would add up to a lot of time toning and processing if I didn’t use lights.

If I do my job right, I rarely have to tone anything. In fact, about 95% of the images I turn in only need a crop in Photo Mechanic. geMost high school gyms are full of distracting backgrounds; from cheerleaders on the baseline to light-up ad tables and scoreboard video screens, there is a lot of visual clutter to contend with. By controlling what is, and most importantly, is not illuminated, I am able to reduce some of these distractions.

_My standard lighting kit that I use on a daily basis during basketball season._

## The Kit

The following items make up my standard lighting kit.

**Big lights**: A pair of [Paul C. Buff Einstein 640 Monolights](http://paulcbuff.com/e640.php) with [standard reflectors](http://paulcbuff.com/7abr.php) and [15ft power cords](http://paulcbuff.com/powercords.php). A pair [PocketWizard PowerMC2](http://paulcbuff.com/mc2.php) receivers dock in each light. A [Vagabond Mini Lithium](http://www.paulcbuff.com/vm120.php) battery pack allows me to use the Einsteins in some of the pre-historic caves that don't have power outlets.

**Little lights**: One each of the [Nikon SB-900](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050YG3CU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=joelhawksphot-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0050YG3CU) and [SB-800](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00015GYU4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=joelhawksphot-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00015GYU4) speed lights, with [Frio Cold Shoe](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CBTCFC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=joelhawksphot-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004CBTCFC) mounts and [Sanyo Eneloop AA batteries](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UG41XW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=joelhawksphot-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004UG41XW).

**Radio control**: Four [PocketWizard FlexTT5](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001T9NXA0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=joelhawksphot-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001T9NXA0) transceivers as speed light receivers and on-camera transmitters. One [PocketWizard AC3 Zone Controller](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OZ6BQ4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=joelhawksphot-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004OZ6BQ4) to toggle/control zones of lights. Before I moved to PocketWizard, the [Paul C. Buff Cyber Commander system](http://www.paulcbuff.com/cybersync.php) treated me well.

**Grip**: Four [Avenger Super clamps](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BZL06/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=joelhawksphot-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0000BZL06) with [standard studs](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E4L0CI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=joelhawksphot-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001E4L0CI). I avoid using stands as they are bulky, and in most cases, a safety hazard.

## The basics

No matter the size of the gym/arena, it is best for strobes to be at least 3 stops brighter than the ambient exposure in the gym, preferably five. This eliminates most ghosting and prevents the ambient light from changing the color balance of the image.

Most of the gyms I work in these days are incredibly dark, making it easy to overpower the ambient, even with speed lights. This means I’m using the speed lights at 1/4 to 1/2 power, zoomed to 50-70mm and aimed towards the free throw/three point line.

Ideally, the lights should be positioned 10 feet behind the baseline and a similar distance off the sideline, on each side in a fairly symmetrical setup. The higher the better. For the mono lights, I'll work from 1/8 - 1/4 power, as the wider reflectors that I use cover more of the court, eating up some of the output.

## In the field

In reality, very rarely can I set up my lights exactly how I want to. Factors such as available power outlets, mounting options, and working angles often limit my approach. In general, I will use the mono lights only if I am covering one game or am in the same gym for multiple games.

I often have to shoot multiple games in a single night, so for those I'll just carry the set of pre-rigged speed lights shown above.

What follows is a fairly exhaustive set of notes and examples from gyms that I've shot in over the past two months. I've tried to include as much information as possible. I wouldn't consider many of these setups ideal, but they are the reality of what I have to work with.

I shoot from the middle of the baseline, so all directional notes are from this perspective, looking downcourt. In most cases, I've left these images un-cropped.

## Wrapping up

Anyways. If you've made it this far, I hope this guide was of some use. I continue to experiment with these setups, and encourage you to do the same.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to send me an email. Someone else is probably wondering the same thing. Good luck!
