_My post remote camera rigged for today's SIU women's basketball game._

Just a quick set of notes here on working with post remotes, probably my favorite type of camera setup to do for basketball games.

_The camera in position, behind the padding to protect the lens._

Gear wise, I use the same kit I use for my backboard remotes. For rigging, the same approach applies to this setup: two magic arms and a safety point above the camera. I normally use a 28mm prime lens, but anything from 16-35mm tends to work well from this position. I aim the camera straight out and focus on the net. At f/5, most of the near-basket action falls within this zone.

_Using Liveview on my D700 to line up the shot._

With everything lined up, I trigger the remote using my near-court camera, which is usually a D3 with a 24-70mm lens.
