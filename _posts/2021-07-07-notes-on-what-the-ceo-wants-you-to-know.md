title: What the CEO Wants You to Know by Ram Charan
---

> Every organization must serve its customers, manage its cash effectively, use its assets wisely, and constantly improve and grow.

Having not received a single minute of formal business education, I read this book as a starting point for learning about general business practices.

My main takeaway was Charan's definition of growth:

## Growth

Companies that thrive over the long run grow both the top and bottom lines consistently over time. They do it through _good_ growth that is profitable, organic, differentiated, and sustainable.

**Profitable** growth is capital efficient. It earns more money than one could receive by investing in something safe like bonds or a treasury bill.

**Organic** growth naturally flows out of what the company is already doing, which is both efficient and reinforces the organization's creativity.

**Differentiated** growth means providing a product or service that is not a commodity. Customers must prefer it.

**Sustainable** growth does not mean just a quick spike in revenues but leads to continued increases year after year.
