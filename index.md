### Work

I'm a staff software engineer at [GitHub](https://github.com/joelhawksley) on the Ruby Architecture team. I also lead development of the [ViewComponent](https://github.com/github/view_component) framework. I've previously worked at [Galvanize](https://www.galvanize.com/), [Wunder Capital](https://www.wundercapital.com), and [MojoTech](https://www.mojotech.com).

### Career

I've made several contributions to Rails, including [support for 3rd-party component frameworks](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/36388), [a helper for dynamically constructing CSS class names](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/37918), [template path annotations](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/38848), [marking code as uncacheable](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/42365), and [strict locals for templates and partials](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/45602).

I served on the [RubyConf 2024](https://rubyconf.org/) program committee.

### Mentorship

I am a strong believer in the power of peer mentoring. In addition to being a [Big Brother](https://biglittlecolorado.org/), I regularly coach several aspiring engineers in their pursuit of a career in software. I've also volunteered as a scholar guide at RailsConf for several years.

### Photography

I previously worked as a photojournalist at several newspapers including [The Roanoke Times](https://roanoke.com/) and [The Seattle Times](https://www.seattletimes.com/). Since then, I've contracted for [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com) and [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com). I now focus on travel and nature in my [personal work](https://www.hawksleyvisuals.com).
