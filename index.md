### Now

I'm a staff software engineer at [GitHub](https://github.com/joelhawksley), focusing on the health of our Ruby on Rails monolith. I also lead development of the [ViewComponent](https://github.com/github/view_component) framework.

### Career

I've made several contributions to Rails, including [support for 3rd-party component frameworks](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/36388), [a helper for dynamically constructing CSS class names](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/37918), [template path annotations](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/38848), [marking code as uncacheable](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/42365), and [strict locals for templates and partials](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/45602).

I've spoken at RailsConf ([2019](https://youtu.be/y5Z5a6QdA-M), [2020](https://youtu.be/YVYRus_2KZM), [2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoetqsBCsbE), [2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21QG19Zy_g0), [2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j2zlvE_Yj8&t=271s), [2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRUn-yRH0ks)), [RubyConf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vynyFGOZOZ8), [Brighton Ruby](https://brightonruby.com/2022/breaking-up-with-the-bundle-joel-hawksley/), [RubyDay IT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyN1pdmBCtc), [RubyConf Taiwan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGAs0QALAiM), Rocky Mountain Ruby ([2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tR3LJ2cEsE), [2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9e2CsMMLf4U), [2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ck9ZUXwuio)), [Boulder Ruby](https://boulder-ruby.org/), [Ruby Galaxy](https://rubygalaxy.io/talks), [ChicagoRuby](https://chicagoruby.org), [NYC.rb](https://www.meetup.com/NYC-rb/events/jghpgsydcdbmb/), Vancouver Ruby, Toronto Ruby, SF Ruby, Geneva.rb and [Open Source Friday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-mrsmxVy5U). I also served on the [RubyConf 2024](https://rubyconf.org/) program committee and as a scholar guide at RailsConf for several years.

### Mentorship

I am a strong believer in the power of peer mentoring. In addition to being a [Big Brother](https://biglittlecolorado.org/), I regularly coach several aspiring engineers in their pursuit of a career in software.

### Photography

I previously worked as a photojournalist at several newspapers including [The Roanoke Times](https://roanoke.com/) and [The Seattle Times](https://www.seattletimes.com/). Since then, I've contracted for [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com) and [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com). I now focus on travel and nature in my [personal work](https://www.hawksleyvisuals.com).
