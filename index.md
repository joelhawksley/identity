Hi!

My name is Joel, and I live in [Louisville, Colorado](http://louisvilleco.gov/) with my wife Caitlin and our Golden Retriever, Captain.

### Work

I work on the [Design Systems](https://primer.style) team at GitHub, leading development of the [ViewComponent](https://github.com/github/view_component) framework and [Primer ViewComponents](https://github.com/primer/view_components) library. I've previously worked at [Galvanize](https://www.galvanize.com/), [Wunder Capital](https://www.wundercapital.com), and [MojoTech](https://www.mojotech.com).

### Mentorship

I am a firm believer in the power of peer mentoring. In addition to being a [Big Brother](https://biglittlecolorado.org/), I regularly support several aspiring engineers in their pursuit of a career in software.

### Photography

Prior to my career in software, I worked as a photojournalist at several newspapers including [The Roanoke Times](https://roanoke.com/) and [The Seattle Times](https://www.seattletimes.com/). I now focus on [travel](https://www.hawksleyvisuals.com/travel) and [nature](https://www.hawksleyvisuals.com/nature) in my personal work.
