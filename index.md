### Now

My wife [Caitlin](https://www.caitlinhawksley.com) and I recently [lost our home](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-the-hawksleys-rebuild-literally-everything) in the Marshall fire. We're navigating the pain and trauma with the support of friends and family.

### Work

I'm a staff software engineer on the [Design Infrastructure](https://primer.style) team at [GitHub](https://github.com/joelhawksley), leading development of the [ViewComponent](https://github.com/github/view_component) framework and [Primer ViewComponents](https://github.com/primer/view_components) library. I've previously worked at [Galvanize](https://www.galvanize.com/), [Wunder Capital](https://www.wundercapital.com), and [MojoTech](https://www.mojotech.com).

I've spoken at RailsConf ([2019](https://youtu.be/y5Z5a6QdA-M), [2020](https://youtu.be/YVYRus_2KZM), [2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoetqsBCsbE), 2022), [RubyConf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vynyFGOZOZ8), [Brighton Ruby](https://brightonruby.com/), [RubyDay IT](https://2021.rubyday.it/talks_speakers/), [RubyConf Taiwan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGAs0QALAiM), [Boulder Ruby](https://boulder-ruby.org/), [Ruby Galaxy](https://rubygalaxy.io/talks), [ChicagoRuby](https://chicagoruby.org), [NYC.rb](https://www.meetup.com/NYC-rb/events/jghpgsydcdbmb/), [Open Source Friday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-mrsmxVy5U), and on the [Remote Ruby](https://remoteruby.transistor.fm/125), [Ruby on Rails](https://5by5.tv/rubyonrails/276), [Ruby Blend](https://radiopublic.com/the-ruby-blend-WDewaV/s1!9aab9), [Rails with Jason](https://www.codewithjason.com/rails-with-jason-podcast/joel-hawksley/), and [Ruby Rogues](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/rr-461-rethinking-the-view-layer-with-components-with-joel-hawksley/) podcasts.

### Mentorship

I am a firm believer in the power of peer mentoring. In addition to being a [Big Brother](https://biglittlecolorado.org/), I regularly support several aspiring engineers in their pursuit of a career in software.

### Photography

I previously worked as a photojournalist at several newspapers including [The Roanoke Times](https://roanoke.com/) and [The Seattle Times](https://www.seattletimes.com/), and have contracted for [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com) and [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com). I now focus on [travel](https://www.hawksleyvisuals.com/travel) and [nature](https://www.hawksleyvisuals.com/nature) in my personal work.
