## How I got into software

I started writing code when I was in middle school. I think I bought my first domain name in 7th grade. I built websites with Frontpage and Dreamweaver and built games in Flash.

I did an independent study in PHP and MySQL in high school and started hacking on WordPress to build a portfolio website for my photography. I also modified a photography gallery tool to sell pictures I took at sporting events to my friends' parents.

In college, I studied photojournalism and took a couple of computer science classes on the side. I kept improving my portfolio website software, selling it as a service to my classmates.

After working at a handful of newspapers, I decided to change careers when I lost my manager to a layoff. I called a friend from college who worked as a software developer and asked him if he could teach me how to do it. He offered me an apprenticeship where we worked long days together pairing on Ruby on Rails applications, teaching me the craft of professional software development. After a few months, I was self-sufficient.
