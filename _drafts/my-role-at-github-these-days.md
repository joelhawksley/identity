# One year as a staff engineer at GitHub

I'm often asked what it's like being a staff engineer at GitHub. The short answer is that it depends. Here is my attempt at a longer answer after a year in the role.

## What I do

I help other GitHub engineers be happy and impactful. I find that if the former is true, the latter is easier to accomplish. My general area of focus is frontend architecture.

## Lots of 1:1s

I've found that the best way to do my job is by coaching and mentoring other engineers, from juniors to staff. Depending on the situation, I set recurring time daily, a couple days a week, weekly, or bi-weekly.

1:1s can range from hour-long technical deep dives to ad-hoc sessions for just a couple of minutes.

My current schedule has sessions with 11 engineers: two bi-weekly, seven weekly, and two twice a week.

Our team keeps a rotation called FR that has one person fielding incoming requests, allowing the rest of us to have more focus time. Acting as a distraction shield.

I've long set Slack to be away at all times. Engineering work requires long periods of uninterrupted focus time and I've seen too many teams get bogged down with responding to every last ping at a moment's notice. TODO MAKERS vs. MANAGERS schedule

When I need to get deep work done, I close down Slack and forget it exists.

Unless I'm on our first responder rotation, I do not have Slack on my phone.

I try to check my GitHub notifications twice a day: once first thing in the morning to unblock my colleagues in Europe and again before I wrap up to hand things off to folks in Asia.
